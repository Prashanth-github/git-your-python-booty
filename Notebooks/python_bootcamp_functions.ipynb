    "## Function Definition\n",
    "A function is an object that is written only once but can be called when needed throughout the code.  It can take in arguments (which are objects), and return objects. However, no variables need to be passed in or out, and return does not need to be specified.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In python a function is defined with def, and looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def some_function_name (variable_passed_in_1, variable_passed_in_2, ...):\n",
    "        ...Some really cool code here...\n",
    "        return (variable_passed_out_1, variable_passed_out_2...)\n",
    "            \n",

    "    add_names_to_phonebook(phone_book,names_and_numbers_list)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    remove_names_from_phonebook(phone_book, names_to_remove)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Where both of these lines refer to a function that does exactly what it says it is going to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions don't rely on nor do they change data outside of the function. \n",
